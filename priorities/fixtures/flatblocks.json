All users are able to design the map by selecting what data layers to show, explore the map using pan and zoom functionality, and investigate data sets pertaining to juniper as well as wildlife species, protected lands and management. Registered users sign in by clicking on the \u201csign in\u201d menu in the upper right hand corner.\r\n\r\n<h3>Build a Map</h3>\r\n<p>\r\nTo begin exploring the Juniper Management Tool, click the \u201cSelect Data to Map\u201d tab at the top of the map page.  You will see six data themes that organize the spatial data into logical groupings. The <B>Base Map</B> heading layer at the top of the tree view will have different third-party base maps to choose from such as aerial imagery, topography or terrain. Under the <B>Base Layers</B> heading you can select data that will help orient you in the map, such as cities, highways and hydrology.  The map will initially have the following layers selected as a base map for you: planning units, juniper utilization centers, roads, cities and basic terrain.  To see a specific watershed name simply hover your mouse over the watershed.  You can click on each watershed in the map for additional summarized information such the acreage of juniper phases, protected lands, sage grouse and pygmy rabbit habitat.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Explore Data Layers and Watershed Summarized Information</h3>\r\n<p>\r\nThere are a number of data themes that organize pertinent data for juniper management, such as wildlife species and juniper phases. Other data sets available for viewing are data used to generate the priorities including species specific information and cost factors related to different treatment types and geographic variables.  These data are under the heading \u201cSummarized Data\u201d. To explore these layers, click on the arrow next to the heading and a tree view will expand exposing the layers. Click on the check box next to the desired layer and you will see it appear on the map. Many of these data are imbedded in subsequent sub-folders. For additional information on any of these data layers, please see the <a href=\"/home/data_dictionary.pdf\">data dictionary</a>. \r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Create a New Juniper Management Prioritization Scenario</h3>\r\n<p>\r\nAdd descriptive text here\r\n</p>",
